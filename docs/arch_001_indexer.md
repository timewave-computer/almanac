# Product Requirements Document: Cross-Chain Indexer

## Summary

We are building a high-performance cross-chain indexer that will initially support Ethereum and Cosmos chains, with future expansion to Solana and Move-based chains. The indexer will focus on tracking Valence protocol contracts and related blockchain state, while being architected to support future Causality integration. The system will use a hybrid RocksDB and PostgreSQL approach to satisfy both high-performance requirements for strategists/relayers and complex query capabilities for frontend applications.

## Background

The Valence protocol operates across multiple blockchain ecosystems, requiring comprehensive indexing of on-chain state for monitoring, analysis, and cross-chain interactions. Currently, there is no unified solution for tracking Valence contracts across different blockchains with the appropriate determinism classifications and performance characteristics needed for our use case.

## Objectives

1. Develop a robust cross-chain indexer capable of tracking Valence contract state across Ethereum and Cosmos chains
2. Implement a hybrid storage architecture using RocksDB for high-performance paths and PostgreSQL for complex queries
3. Classify Cosmos events by determinism level to ensure appropriate handling
4. Create an extensible architecture to support future Causality integration
5. Provide the foundation for adding additional chains including Solana and Move-based chains

## Target Users

1. **Strategists and Relayers**: Require real-time access to chain state with minimal latency
2. **Frontend Applications**: Need rich querying capabilities for historical data and cross-chain state
3. **Protocol Developers**: Need visibility into contract state and cross-chain interactions
